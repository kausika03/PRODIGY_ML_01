# House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

## Overview
This repository contains the code for implementing a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. The goal is to create a simple yet effective model for estimating house prices, leveraging the features of square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms.

## Kaggle Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and is focused on housing information. It includes data on various features of houses, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and the corresponding prices. You can find the dataset  https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data.

## Model Used
The chosen model for this project is a linear regression model. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm that aims to establish a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. In this case, the input features are square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms, and the target variable is the house price.
